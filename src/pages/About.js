            <p>I need to have a purpose in my work, one that helps people thrive. Through technology, I can solve problems, build amazing things, all while creating a brighter world. Prior to software development, I have a background in psychology. Most of my professional life has been spent as a Youth and Young Adult Counselor. I'm ready to use the skills learned from this experience in a more technical role as a software developer.</p>
